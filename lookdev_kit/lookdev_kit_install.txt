This is my first Python project. Expect bugs and crashes. If something doesn't work well please contact me on ArtStation. 

Bugs and crashes will be fixed in time and the project itself will be updated. 

Also, it is a free tool, use it as is. I hope you will find it usefull. 



REQUIREMENTS:

I have tested Lookdev Kit 2.5 on Maya 2023 and MtoA 5.2.0.  

All newer Arnold version should be compatible.

It requires python 3. So, you need Maya 2022 or higher. 



INSTALATION:

PYTHON 3:
- copy entire lookdev_kit folder from .zip to your MyDocuments Maya scripts folder. It is usually here:

C:\Users\<user_name>\Documents\maya\scripts


You can create button by yourself:

- open script editor and in PYTHON tab paste following code:


import imp 
from lookdev_kit import ldv_kit

imp.reload(ldv_kit)
ldv_kit.buildUI()


You can always select that code in script editor and middle-click-drag it to your shelf to create a button, so you can call it when needed.


PYTHON 2:
If you are on Maya version with python 2, I left the old copy of lookdevkit script in same folder, command for launching python 2 version should be:



from lookdev_kit import ldv_kit_py2

reload(ldv_kit_py2)
ldv_kit_py2.buildUI()

If some stuff doesn't look exactly like in video, I probably changed some things.

Thanks to Aleksandar Kocic (aleksandarkocic.com) for some tips to make this more usable. Also thanks to all my friends who "beta tested" Lookdev kit.
